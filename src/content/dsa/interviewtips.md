#### i amagicalbook on time management

``` bash
I had this exact same problem just a month before my Meta interview

My advice here might seem a little like “if you’re blind, just see” but I can promise you that it definitely helped me.

So the way our brains work is mostly the principle of least resistance. This is why addictions are so hard to kick off it just becomes your brains way of processing a “tuesday”. 

And I think that in order to better manage your time you just have to kind of force yourself to manage time in the sense that managing time becomes a metric that you measure. So pick problems that are already in your comfort zone and then mock with yourself and always take up exactly 6 minutes no more or no less to get to a place where youve explained the entire solution. 

After that once your brain is primed to problem solve within 15-20 minutes, take that approach and apply it to new problems as well. 

Keep doing this over and over again. 

You want to take out all of the variables that are either fictional (eg anxiety) or real (eg typing speed) and in order to do that I created my own like typing game where all I would is just mindlessly type out the solution over and over again to build up extreme amount of intuition of template code.

#### themnades on time management
``` bash
That section is bang on my experience. 
I used to think I had poor time management, but really it was a couple of smaller issues that were making me feel like i was slow / running out of time -
spending too much time getting buy-in/going over the solution,
thinking too much about edge cases
not having practiced actually coding enough (a bit silly tbh, but i'd know the solution but get caught up on implementation details for boilerplate stuff like managing bounds during (graph) traversal due to lack of practice)

The most impactful change I made was being able to write out boilerplate & template code quickly while reasoning/explaining the solution (through more practice). This way, when I was actually writing the core logic, I had more time and could discuss details of approach without wasting time on simple stuff.
